## Team Names and Information
Team Name: "The Sudoku Solvers"
Team Members: Michael Lieu and Will Schreiner
Project Advisor: Fred Annexstein

## Abstract
This project is centered around the design and development of a Sudoku Solver programmed entirely in Python. This involves the implementation 
of a user-friendly GUI using TkInter tools that will allow the user to interact with the board and the implementation of functions containing 
algorithms that will take inputs from the GUI, solve the board based on those inputs, and pass them to the GUI. The main distinction of this 
project is the utilization of human-solvable algorithms as opposed to computer solvable algorithms, the latter of which rely on brute force 
tactics while the human-solvable algorithms are more intuitive in nature.
